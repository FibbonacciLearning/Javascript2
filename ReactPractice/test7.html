/*State is way to store data that can be changed. 
componentDidMount : This method gets called just after our component gets rendered (or mounted, as React calls it).
setState : This method allows you to update the value of the state object. It takes an object as its argument. This object contains all the properties you want to merge into the state object.
We will be using the setInterval function to increase the strikes property by 100 every second. We’re going to do all of this immediately after our component has been rendered using the built-in componentDidMount method.  
Whenever you call setState and update something in the state object, your component’s render method gets automatically called. This kicks off a cascade of render calls for any component whose output is also affected. The end result of all this is that what you see on your screen is the latest representation of your app’s UI state. Keeping your data and UI in sync is one of the hardest problems with UI development, so it’s nice that React takes care of this for us.

//constructor runs runs before your component gets rendered.
// We’re telling React to set an object containing our strikes property (initialized to 0).

        this.state = {
            strikes : 0
        };
        this.timerTick = this.timerTick.bind(this); //bind the function timertick to the class component. Otherwise babel will not be able to understand that strikes inside the ticmertick function is same as strikes property inside the constructor. If you don't provide Babel throws TypeError Cannot read property 'strikes' of undefined at timerTick. ALso, the UI shows 0 which is the initial value of the property. So, it is very important to bind the function to component, so that timertick can use the property strikes and its value for computing new value of the same property.

        });
    };
//componentDidMount is a React built-in function and has a setinterval method to do something when the component last mounted successfully. SetInterval method internally invokes the timertick function every 1000 microseconds. So timerTick keeps on getting invoked by setInternal method of built-in componentDidMount function which is itself invoked each time the component renders on screen.
